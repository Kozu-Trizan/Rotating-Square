# The Background
Inspired from the famous donut.c project featuring a spinning donut (torus) in console using C programming language I decide to give something similar (less cooler) a try. Similar projects already exist on the internet.
However this project is built from scratch as this was all done for the purpose of learning only (and to do something cool ><)

# Compatibility
This project uses windows API via <windows.h> header file hence this is only compatible for windows operating system.
